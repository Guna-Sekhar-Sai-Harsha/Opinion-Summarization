1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Thai tea with sea salt creama - a bit on the milky side but I love it.a bit pricey since drinks with pearls come out to about $ 5there are games to play too but u need to ask the server for them ( and u can only ask if u bought a drink first too ! ) I knock off a star cuz their popcorn is expensive and there 's about 20 pieces max that comes in a 3.5 inch bucket - cue photosskip the snack but one of my faves in Vegas , I 'll be back	3.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I came here with some friends at their recommendation and I was not disappointed ! It has a very cute vibe to it with tons of space to hang out . The porch is perfect ! I love that there are board games and video games available to play . I have ordered a taro milk tea and a jasmine milk tea both of which were good . The boba is a good texture and consistency . I also tried the bulgogi fries . The fries were a little crunchy but the sauce and other toppings were so good I didn 't mind . I would definitely recommend and I will be back with more friends !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I love this place so much ! ! ! The girls that work here are so nice ! They make sure that my friend and I are enjoying ourselves and helped us , explaining the menu options when I was curious about what they had . ( The girl with the lighter short hair was superrrr nice and very sweet ! ! ! ! ) The tea is super good ! I love the passion fruit tea and will definitely come back just for it alone . The vibe is so nice here too . I will be recommending all my friends to come here ! O :	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Tea of Joy has a lot of potential . Tried their Jasmine Milk Tea with boba on a recent visit . The tea itself was great , however , the honey boba definitely needed help ( soft , but tasteless ) . There was a new employee working the cash register but he was ultra friendly . Hopefully they can up their boba game !	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Green Thai Milk Tea ... Get it and thank me later . Drinks come in two sizes , I got the large and opted for honey boba and herbal jelly . My sister and I were definitely conflicted on what drinks to indulge on . The gal working was definitely helpful and went in depth with their top drinks . I 'm usually pretty indecisive to begin with , so it was great to have her help out . My husband got a strawberry and mango slush with boba which he definitely was a fan of . They deff do boba right ! I really wanna try their pana cotta and macaroon selection next time I 'm in town !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	serves great milk teas and their boba is always in the best shape in very cozy atmosphere.The location is sec in the hotzone , this could mean a good thing for Vegas visitors or can be troublesome for locals.But I think it 's the best milk tea spot growing up in southern cali I had been having these beverages since 1998 .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	The green Thai tea is amazing as well as the coffee with coconut . Very different ! I like to add chia seeds to my green Thai tea . It 's a pretty young atmosphere here and it 's quite busy in the weekend nights . I love this place for the great variety of boba and coffee drinks they have as well as the late hours .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	i love this place ! ! my friends and i come here every weekend ! the royal milk tea is my favorite they keep the place clean and the staff always checks on you to see if you 're doing ok. also , the owner is very friendly and welcoming ! they have a selection of video and board games , so it 's a nice place to just chill	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	ラスベガスに 来 てスムージーのお 店 は 何 店 か 行 きましたが 、 ここはフレッシュの 果 物 で 調 理 するので 甘 すぎず 、 さっぱりとした 味 わいでした 。 店 内 もモダン 風 に 仕 上 げており 、 落 ち 着 けるスペースですね ^ _ ^ スタッフの 対 応 は 最 高 です 。 是 非 皆 様 も 立 ち 寄 ってみてはいかがですか 。	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Durian smoothie-decent but for a huge durian lover , it wasn 't strong enough in terms of flavor.My daughter had the tiramisu . We were hoping for the cute shovel and clay pot container but it was in regular plastic cup . So sad , bring it back . She liked her tiramisu and Thai iced ices with crystal boba .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I 've only been here once and I 'm already planning on making this my usual hangout spot . It is such an adorable tea place and their dessert is some of the cutest I 've seen . I went around the time they had just opened so things didn 't run as smoothly as I had wished ( it just took longer than I expected ) but it was well worth the wait . I was there for a few hours without realizing it because they have such a welcoming atmosphere . I can 't wait to go back .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I love their green thai milk tea ! Such an interesting flavor and their boba is nice and chewy . Such a cute place to hangout and they even have games here . Definitely would recommend !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Stopped by here to satisfy a boba craving ! The guy that took our order was super nice and gave great suggestions knowing it was our first time . I got the Sea Salt Jasmine Green Tea and my boyfriend got the Wintermelon Green Milk Tea . Both were regular sweet and not overly sweet , which was nice . We also got an order of the popcorn chicken and it turned out to be a great late night snack ! The dipping sauce that came along with it had a nice little kick too !	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I love Tea of Joy ! ! ! ! They close late which is great for me because I 'm always out late , and this place is my go-to since it 's the only place that 's open ! They have a lot of special which are really creative . Only downside is that they run out of boba often at night but I don 't blame them since it takes a while to cook .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I was wondering if you guys plan to franchise your boba shop ? If so , I 'm very interested in opening a franchise in the Summerlin area . Anyway we can get in contact and talk it over in person ?	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Best Iced Thai Milk Tea that I have found in Vegas so far . That and their popcorn chicken made the perfect late night snack when I came in for the first time around 10pm the other night . I knew it would be good just by the crowd that was still there that late and they did not disappoint !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	My favorite place to get my bubble tea fix in ! JOHN IS MAH MAN ! Love the environment here and the vibe everyone puts off . All the pastries are baked in-house and taste scrumptious . Great place to study and great place to hang out	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	The tea here is soooo good , and the boba tastes fresh ! I would definitely come back . I like how they have different sweetness levels which is good for people with different tastes . They even have avovado smoothies ! ( weird ) but my friend had a particular taste and we went to 2 different places to find it .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	This is a cute addition to spring mountains collection of boba shops lol . They sell a variety of deserts and they even have a cute patio area for guests lounge . I ordered coffee jelly for the first time and i loved it , I will definitely be back .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I love this new Boba Place the space is comfy to be at and I love the cute decor . They have both video games and board games . I brought my friends here , the guys play games and we girls do homework # nerdstatus . My most fav is the Royal Milk Tea and Jasmine Milk Tea . Loveeeee . Def gonna come back for more	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Have been coming here for the past couple of months . Place is really clean nice and cozy . Has outdoor seating which is a plus . The teas are excellent here . I also had some of their desserts which are pretty good . They have games as well which is pretty cool .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I didn 't even know this place existed . It is attached right next to the Korean BBQ restaurant Magal . After finishing my delicious meal at Magal we stumbled upon Tea of Joy . What a treat as they have many varieties of bubble tea , desserts and snack items ! The interior is so cute and modern . They even have video games you can enjoy for free as you sip your tea ! Great place to grab and drink and catch up with friends .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	After trying this place a couple of times , I can finally write my review on this place . I really enjoy how there are many food items as well as drinks ! Everything is pretty tasty . My only complaint is that with the smoothies and slushes , I 've had a lot of unblended ice cubes remaining in my drinks . Other than that , I will definitely see in the future if they improve I will edit my post to a 5 star review !	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I love the not so long list of the drink menu . This definitely narrowed down my option when picking up the milk drink . I always order the specialty drinks ; panda and the dragon milk tea . Taste perfect due to the fact that it wasn 't too sweet . I love the wide variety of games available for the customers and the cleanliness of the area . My bf and I always play the board games . Overall I will be coming back to this location . I love the place and the service .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I had a very short visit here after having dinner at the Chinatown Mall . I decided to stop by to grab a drink as a dessert and I went with a lavender milk tea . It was pretty good but I don 't think I would order it again saying that they have such a large menu ; I would want to try something else . The interior of this place is very aesthetically pleasing . I am a NY native and I wish NY had something like this . If I were to come back to Vegas ! !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Tea of Joy is one of a few decent boba tea places that 's opened late in Vegas . They have a lot of drink options to choose from . My favorite things to order here are the durian and durian-avocado smoothies . Just beware , the wait for the smoothies can be a bit lengthy even on days with no line . I also had their signature panda milk tea , which I thought was too sweet . I love their crystal bobas , but I 'm not a fan of their regular black bobas .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Great boba and staff but honestly the desserts are not the way to go . The matcha cheesecake needs a A LOT of improvement . The oreo cheesecake needs some improvement . I feel like they need to redo and taste some of their desserts before selling them .	3.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	They have corn milk ! ! ! ! If you love corn , you need to try corn milk ; it actually tastes like sweet corn . It is a little heavy , kinda reminds me of eggnog , so ask them if there 's any way to lighten or water down the drink . I asked for extra ice and drank it a little later . I also love that they offer white pearls ( agar pearls ) . There are so many different drink offerings , I can definitely see myself returning when I come to Vegas again !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I ordered the passionfruit green tea but there was a weird smokey taste to it . Decided to try their Hokkaido milk tea but it tasted powdery and tasted nothing like hokkaido milk tea . The drinks arent that great but its a good place to play games .	1.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Service is wonderful ! The workers here are all very sweet and helpful . They 're very patient and explain everything on the menu thoroughly ! The tea is amazing too . My friend had brought me a wintermelon , but on this visit I got the dragon tea . I have to say , both were amazing . I also bought the tiramisu and that was really good too . It wasn 't overly sweet , but it had just the right amount of taste to it . Really wonderful , I 'll definitely come back again !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Came by here to kill some time and tried the boba milk tea . Must say it was a very tasty drink . I also was impressed with how nice the staff was and how clean the environment is . I 'll be back often to play some games and try all the menu !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	ordered the jasmine milk tea with boba , which were both super sweet. i love sweet , but not the kind of sweet where i felt like i was getting cavities from every sip of jasmine milk tea or bite of boba. i suppose i could have had them remake it , but i didn 't bother with it since they were super busy and it took 30 mins for one of my friend 's smoothie to be made. their popcorn chicken was alright .. typical vegas popcorn chicken. the stars are for the tiramisu presentation and design / decor of this place , however the place was very crammed and i got a little claustrophobic in there .	2.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Cozy modern trendy place . I will definitely be back to try other drinks . We came here for soft opening . We ordered Panda Milk Tea with Crystal Boba and Passion Fruit Slush both were fresh !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I ordered Dragon milk tea which is so delicious . The drink itself comes with coffee jelly and honey boba . It is a perfect mixture of milk tea and toppings . They also have boardgames , PS4 , and Netflix ! DEFINITELY COME BACK FOR MORE .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Loveee the Royal Milk Tea here . They have a wide selection of toppings . The store is new and looks very clean and neat . The special Durian Smoothie is good too though I 'm usually not a big fan of Durian .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Love this place ! Awesome customer service , very friendly staff every single time I visit . Their food and drinks are really good . I 've tried pretty much most of the milk teas and iced teas flavors . I like the lychee flavored iced teas and jasmine milk teas , both with lychee jelly . The bulgogi fries is a must try ! Definitely recommended ! A + + + +	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Great place to get some Milk Tea , boba and grass jelly . Will definitely be coming back to try their other specialty drinks . Also their bulgogi fries and popcorn chicken were pretty bomb too . They close late so it 's perfect for people that work swing shift .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	The presentation of the place and the food were really nice . They have a TV where you can play video games . I ordered the Matcha drink , but it didn 't taste like Matcha that much to me , maybe like a hint of it . My friends tried it and didn 't taste the Matcha at all . They enjoyed their drink though . I enjoyed my drink at least , even though I couldn 't taste the Matcha that much . The boba was nice and Chewy though . The staff was really nice and helpful .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	My favorite boba hangout spot in Las Vegas . Huge patio filled with tables and chairs to chill with friends . Several different types of drinks ranging from Thai tea to smoothies . Yummy desserts such as cream brûlée ! And my favorite snack is the bulgolgi fries .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	One of the employees ( her name was Qing according to the receipt ) was so rude to us . My friend was too upset that she had to leave the store to calm herself . How food taste is no longer important . We are not coming back anymore .	1.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Service is a 5 STAR .. explained the flavors of TEA which is a + + + + . Spaces inside and out and Music really nice . Will come back coz another plus is that they are opened until 2am ....	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Where do I start ? Wow ! Their Durian smoothie is so good ! And they added REAL durian . I 've had other places that has durian ice cream but you can 't really taste the durian . I will definitely come back for the durian smoothie . My boyfriend had the green Thai tea . I would say it 's okay ... not my fave .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Love their dragon milk tea with herbal jelly . I have never tried panna cotta before and somehow the sweet young lady at the front counter convinced me to try the strawberry panna cotta & creme bruele ! It was DELICIOUS , so creamy yet very light in texture like gelatin ! I will be sure to try the other panna cotta flavors next time !	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I went here on Thursday night and it 's pretty nice ! They have tons of different drinks and jellies to choose from and they have a ton of different desserts . I had the green apple iced tea with lychee jelly at 50 % sweetness and we tried the fruity pebble macaron as well as the mango and lychee macaron . We also tried the creme brûlée and the Oreo cheesecake . Everything was really tasty and I definitely want to go back and try the tiramisu in the mini flower pot . They have a patio and inside area . Very clean and worth checking out . It 's behind wharo Korean bbq .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Ordered a strawberry banana smoothie and totallyyyy in LOVE ! New place , glad I found it . Server , drink and the atmosphere are all LEGEND-waitforit-DARY ! ! ! Alex ( one of the servers ) is the sweetest I 've met , her smile totally made my day brighter !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Their Teas are so good and for a cheap price . I got their Bulgogi fries and they were so good , i didn 't think that they were gonna have a little spice to it but that just made it better and the fries had a crispy crunch to it and it was just ... ( i 'm speechless , that 's how good they were )	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Decided to give this place a try after lunch since it was nearby and the staff was very welcoming as we entered . The menu has a wide variety of drinks and desserts ! I decided to get the jasmine milk tea with boba and ordered a couple macaroon for dessert . The decor is really cool here and it 's a perfect spot to stop and catch up over a drink with a friend !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I got the wintermelon milk tea and it was bomb ! I got it with 50 % sugar and some boba . Idk what else to say about it except how delicious it is . They accept card as well .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Service was nice but the drink wasn 't so great . I ordered the Rose Milk Tea with Boba . The boba was very mushy and the rose milk tea was very pink , kinda like Peto Bismol . The atmosphere was really nice , has a lot of space so larger groups shouldn 't be a problem .	2.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Tried the bulgogi fries and lychee tea this time . The bulgogi fries are soooo good ! You won 't regret trying them . And I can say that the lychee tea is my new fave had a great experience with the food and service !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	This is probably one of my favorite tea place in town ! I 'm becoming a regular here Must try their green thai tea with crystal boba , yum ! Friendly and welcoming workers ! They even have variety of card and board games ! Great for large groups	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Favorite item on the menu ? Only reason I come back . The DURIAN smoothie ! If you hate it , too bad cause I aint worried . I 'm here every week so I 'm getting the bulgogi fries . It 's a must trust me . Huge menu , vast variety of drinks to chose from as well as there desserts that are displayed right there at the entrance . Food is awesome , the service is superb . What 's not to like .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I LOVE tea of joy ! Their mango black tea with boba is amazing and so light and refreshing ! I do wish they had better cups , the plastic top always spills over a little bit but it 's not a huge deal . Also their macarons are super cheap ! My favorite macaron is the fruity pebble one ! I also love their game selection ! I was able to play jenga , exploding kittens , and cards against humanity . It 's a great hangout spot and I really enjoy going here	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Of course I got my usual Jasmine milk tea but it was a bit different than the usual ones I have had . This one is a bit on the creamier side . It wasn 't bad though but I wish it had more of that Jasmine taste to it . It was open until 2 AM which is a plus , for those late night boba runs after a night at the strip and whatnot .	3.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I LOVE THIS PLACE . Every time I come to Vegas I go to tea station ... which is good ... they have snacks and good drinks and they 're open late ... but this place is BETTER . It 's so cute and the workers are SO NICE. the drinks are fantastic ( especially the royal tea ) and they sample everything ! ! ! They 're open til 2 am and the place itself is so cozy / cute . Love love love ! Coming back within the next few days as much as possible until I go back home to California	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I had the same experience with other people . I asked what is the panda milk tea ? " It 's a special tea " Oh my god ! What a déjà-vu ! Same as other comments . The oolong milk tea didn 't taste like oolong . The bubbles didn 't stand as well.However it 's nothing about she wants to remain their recipe secret it 's about the ATTITUDE . RUDE . Treat me if I were stupid . Unfortunately I never stepped a foot in there anymore . With that all good reviews , I don 't see any reasons why I need to visit it again .	1.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Really dope place . Delicious drinks and snacks ( Thai tea + sea salt cream + crystal boba is the business ) . Extremely nice staff . Late nite crowd .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	The owner John his really nice . Love the teas macaroons bulgogi fries and chicken poppers ... nice place to hang out with friends ! ! ! They also have a big tv where u can play ps4 games . They also have other board games to play with . And the more I come they get more varieties of desserts so far I have tried the coffee macaroons and caramel brûlée and both are gold ! My favorite here is the bulgogi fries ! ! !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	This place has an amazing environment , not to mention the owner John is a super great guy as well ! You don 't often see an owner who is actually willing to work at their own business . The drinks are also great as well , I love their teas the most .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	It was my first time at this boba tea location and ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT ! Very cute inside , staff was very nice , and most important ... the food and TEAS were delicious ! I will definitely be coming back !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Great place to get boba at 1am ! They also have creme brûlée available and various other desserts . My husband ordered a taro slushie made with real taro . I had their dragon milk tea which was delicious . This place had a lot of great reviews for a reason . I would definitely come back here again . My family ended up playing a couple of games while waiting for their drinks . The guy who helped us out was really friendly and even gave us samples of their most popular drinks . Thanks for the awesome service !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Fantastic tea shop in the heart of Chinatown . Super friendly crew , great drinks and snacks / desserts . I 've met many friends here and it 's also my fam 's favourite spot . Will be back many times !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Good location right at china town . I come here to hangout or informal meetings because this is at the center of town . The shop closes late so it 's good to stop by from a quick drink after work hours.Clean surrounding and nice atmosphere . There are board games to use and a gaming console at one corner . This location has a big patio .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Comfortable environment , clean and they have a couch with board games . Staffs were nice to let me try the white bubble , I like the original more . Got the pandan bubble tea , green Thai tea with soy milk and plain milk tea . Green Thai tea was interesting , reminds me of jasmine tea , very floral . Pandan bubble tea wasn 't what I expected , I don 't taste the pandan at all . The plain milk tea was good , classic . Played uno until we finished the teas . Would revisit .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Cute place , good service and good drinks and they deliver drinks to your table as well ! Patio plenty of seats . The only thing I don 't like is they allow smokers smoke in the patio . If you are not a smoker or cannot stand smoke . Avoid patio when smokers present .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	awesome place ! its a hidden gem behind a bbq joint. the interior is way better than sny other cafes in chinatown and the staff members were really friendly ! !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Cute tea shop in the heart of Chinatown , right next to Magal Bbq . They have a variety of tea flavors for everyone ! Strawberry , honeydew , chocolate , green apple , mocha , taro , mango , coffee , avocado , oolong , jasmine , just to name a few . I usually go for my usual favorite , taro , but thought to try something different . I ordered the Green Thai Milk Tea and it is so clean and refreshing , kinda wish I got a larger cup ! If you want a few bite to eat , they have appetizers to munch on as well as desserts .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Awesome place to chill out , one of a kind and clean decorations , nice touch on the PS4 for customers to enjoy . Very yummy drinks and dessert . So far i love them all .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Great atmosphere and great boba ! Very friendly staff . I tried the green tea Thai boba . Very unusual with a lot of depth in flavor . Definitely a must try !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Nothing special . Staff is nice enough but appear to not want to be there . Paid extra for boba and received maybe 13 boba balls . With SO many boba places in town , I 'll skip this one . Brew tea bar is still the best in town .	3.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Tried the speacial panda one .. uhm maybe not get it with the boba it didn 't taste like the sample . They have free samples , just ask . Friendly environment . Bring your vape and make a friend outside . Mixture of college students and high school kids , chill ambience with nice music in the background . They 're open late so that 's convenient . I prefer this place than Kung fu tea that 's down the road . They have board games you needa ask first but exploding kittens is one of them .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	My new favorite spot in town ! I love the serene type setting , the tons of options for the desserts , and more ! The serving was just a lil bit less of how much it cost , but it 's okay i guess since they 're all good ! Now i have a free drink when i come back ! Can 't wait !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	The atmosphere of the place is very cute . My friends said that this place was a good boba spot , so I tried it out . I ordered a taro slush with boba . The first thing wrong was that it literally took 30-40mins for my drink to come out . The second is that my drink didn 't even taste like taro . It was pure water ... I guess I ordered the water slush with boba .	2.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	It was cute and simple . Your typical tea / boba shop . I had a nice time enjoying my passionfruit tea ( delicious ) as well as enjoying some jenga with my boo .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	A Really cool hang out place while sipping on tasty tea , delicious appetizers and all while enjoying quality time with friends and family : ) love this place we always come back ! Also love the fact that they 're open late nights and are very kid friendly with provided board games , tv and a game console !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Had the Matcha Green tea here and it has the most flavor by far compared to any other place I 've had . Their boba pearls here are also really nice and soft , with a good flavor . Top quality .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	This cute little boba shop is open on Spring Mountain near Magal BBQ . They have open patio seating which will be awesome for when summer nights come . The inside is pretty small , just a few tables and a couch , but they have plenty to offer . Boba , jelly , desserts , and some food . We tried the boba tea and to me it wasn 't anything special . I liked the popcorn chicken and garlic parmesan fries . Will definitely come back to try the macaroons and honey toast another time . For now , they 're just okay in my books .	3.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Tea of joy ? ! More like tea of death ! Lol . Literally my friend and I almost died trying to suck the boba through the small straw they gave us on the to go order . Not sure why they would give us small straws with a boba tea ? The tea was okay too I 've tried better . Definitely a place I won 't go back to after almost having to preform the Heimlich maneuver on my friend . But seriously should consider giving people big straws on the to go order !	2.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	We come for the fun and stay for the boba.The boba menu is plentiful , skip the food . If they can do the food better . As simple as furikake fries and do it right . That right there would be the perfect accompaniment to the great space it provides for fun social activities.I 'm sure if you bring your own board games they 'd let ya do it .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Had the Hokkaido Milk Tea and and Bulgogi Fries ! ! Seems like a great place too study ! They have games and couches to relax ! Nice place to chill .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	They serious have the best customer service , best selection and best hand crafted teas here in Vegas . I amSo glad I discovered this place . It was New Year 's Day at about 11 : 45pm and they were the only place open . Score !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I don 't know about this new boba joint . My friends and I were visiting from Phoenix , saw this new place pop up and decided to give it a go . The milk tea itself tastes pre-made , and the boba is really mediocre at best . It wasn 't chewy , it wasn 't mushy , it was just ... ok . They have some delicious looking desert inside the display case though . Perhaps I will try again next time I am in Vegas .	3.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Awesome customer service ! For a new business starting up I give it a 10 / 10 . The manager / owner was outside working along his employees which showed great character . The parking lot is huge and it 's a very comfy environment .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	This is a fun little addition to Chinatown ! I came in late on a weekday with a group and got my go-to drink of almond milk tea w / boba ( soy milk substitute ) . I enjoyed my drink , nothing special . I do like that similar to many other boba / dessert places in the area , Tea of Joy has various board / card games to choose from so you 're encouraged to stick around and chill with friends inside.There are seating inside and out in the front patio . The shared parking lot is decent . Will definitely be back here again .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	They have a variety of drinks and lots of flavors of macaroons . I 'm looking forward for their honey toast and other stuff they have in their menu . I 'll be back for sure ! ! !	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Not the best boba I 've gotten , but not the worst ! Me and my boyfriend are from LA and are big boba snobs so it was a risky thing for us to try something here ! Lol . Haven 't had any boba we 've liked until yes of joy . We got the dragon milk tea , it comes with coffee jelly and I really liked the jelly !	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Cute new boba tea cafe . They had a variety of desserts and unique drinks . I tried the strawberry panna cotta and it was smooth and the strawberry part tasted fresh and not too sweet or tart . Also got the Hokkaido milk tea it was delicious ... but not my fave Hokkaido milk tea . The boba was great not too hard or chewy and just the right texture . Definitely will be back to try the other menu items .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Good place to hang out with friends , no need to worry about parking ! Lots of choices on drinks and food ! My favorite is the Panda milk tea must try ! Staff are very friendly ! laid back settingShould check it out !	5.0	business

1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	This boba place is beyond cute and modern with the cute plants on the b & w tables . The board / card games as well as the PS4 game that customers can use make it such a great hangout place ! The drinks are also really good and have a variety of them with their signature touch ( sea salt ) on some . I got the strawberry mango slush with honey boba and the boba has got to be one of the best .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I ordered Thai green milk tea , 50 % less sweetness and love it ! Can tell the dark tea favor ( not the artificial powder but real leaf tea ) .The place is very large and decorated nicely , feel so relaxing ! Such a good place to hangout or even study !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Tried this shop for the first time the other day . Boba is good average , no complaints ! It 's a cute shop with tons of parking which for boba shops in Chinatown is amazing . Went pretty early in the day so it took a little time to wait for someone to take orders but wasn 't a long wait . Can 't wait to try the other drinks they have !	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	My first time here was still their soft opening . The worker were very nice and helpful . I got the strawberry milk teas . It was a tad bit too sweet for my liking so next time i 'll def get less sweet since you can ask to adjust the sweetness .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I just wanted simple chocolate boba tea , and did not think that it could be screwed up . However , up getting home and trying it I found it to be disgusting . Two sips of it later the entirety was discarded . What a waste of money !	1.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	It 's a nice cozy place to hang out with friends . Drinks are pretty good ! I 've been here several times , and the staffs are pretty nice !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Cuz they 're open fairly late ( or early morning ) , it brought us in for cravings . Their bulgogi fries caught my attention . It didn 't appear in their displayed menu , but if you ask , they have it.You can choose the sweetness of their milk teas . I liked it . They weren 't awesome . Our food and teas sufficed.Interior is cool . Outdoor seating is plentiful . Service is friendly . The only thing I 'd return for are their bulgogi fries . Rating a 3.5 * * * ×	3.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Good atmosphere , quality Foods and drink , and open late ! Great place for students who want to study and have something to snack on . My recommendation is also based on the creme brûlée and avocado smoothie with boba that I had : )	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I have to be honest , my first impression of Tea of Joy wasn 't the best . The drink I ordered wasn 't really to my liking , and the staff seemed a little too quiet and reserved . However , my opinion took a total reversal upon my latest visit ! I ordered the limeade mixed with green tea and bulgogi fries . The drink was a refreshing accompaniment to a hot summer night . I love that this place is opened past midnight unlike most other cafes , and the game selection is on point ! Come here to chill , you wont regret it !	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	They are sooo nice here ! ! They welcomed us in and gave us free macaron samples because we were taking so long to decide on an order !

Definitely coming back and telling everyone I know to check it out !	5.0	business

1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	My favorite boba place in Vegas ! ! And I 've been to quite a lot ! Their rose milk tea with honey boba is my go to . I love that they 're open late and it 's the PERFECT place to hang out and relax with friends . They have games you can borrow and plenty of seating area so don 't be scared to bring a group of people with you , something you can 't do at most the other boba places in town . Great ambiance and great boba , a winning combination !	5.0	business

1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Literally the best place for tea and just wanting to hang out . Great location ! Great employees !

1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	This place is adorable . I got a jasmine milk tea with tapioca , which was solid . I only trust places that allow you to reduce the sugar and was surprised that they bottom out at 50 % sugar level , so it was sweeter than I typically like , but still tasty . The bubbles were also perfectly flavored and ( good ) chewy . I also got some macarons , which were too pretty to resist - also very delicious . I love the interior and that they have lots of games . Looks like it 's getting a great start !	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Great place ! I love the green apple slushie and taro one . I did see a dog walk in and the worker taking orders did politely tell the owner that dog 's are not allowed inside , unless it is a service animal with the obvious vest and paper the handler 's are supposed to carry . Pets are allowed outside of the building though ! Really lovely place !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Tea of joy is a great place to hang ! They have a ton of games and the drinks are delicious ! The honey boba is great ! ! The only thing is that it 's a little pricey compare to other places .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	First time here . So we tried their boba milk tea and Macaroons . Teas were ok but macaroons suck ! , I can make much better macaroons hahaaaa . So yeah I won 't come back here .	3.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Tea of Joy is a very nice place to hang out . They have a great atmosphere to chill with your friends and play some games ( sometimes for hours at a time ) , which is probably why I enjoy their place . Aside from that , the boba is okay ; it 's always very , very sweet and almost artificial tasting . Their macarons are also okay . I tried the panda milk tea and their fruity pebble macaron and while they looked attractive , the sweetness was insane .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	First and last time coming to this place ! Their milk tea isn 't even great and their honey boba taste like medicine . The whole drink tasted like I was drinking some type of air freshener . And inside , it smelled like feet . Even the boba tea at the mall food court taste better !	1.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Cute little college hangout spot ! The bulgogi fries are delish ! ! The caramel delight with honey boba and pudding is amazing . The flavors go together so nicely ! It 's fun to indulge in some games while catching up and having yummy and satisfying appetizers .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I really enjoy the atmosphere here . The music is good and there is a fair amount of seating . It 's a perfect place to drink milk tea and study or play boards games , which they have a supply of . There are a few plugs for your laptop or phone chargers and the service is quick . I would go here again .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Came here because we didn 't want to drive all the way south for our usual spot . Made a good choice ! Love their flavors ... different from usual tea spots . My favorite to get is their Green Thai Tea with Salted Cream on top . Their Dragon Fruit Milk Tea and Corn Milk are very good as well . They offer samples of each if you 're undecided !	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	We bought some milk tea and panna cotta ( one passion fruit , and one plain ) . The tea was decent , I like how they have a low level of sugar I can pick , really recommended . Panna cottas were disappointing though , more like regular jelly than actual panna cotta , they need a taste of actual panna cotta in France . Tip : When you dig a spoon into the panna cotta and the panna cotta immediately broken out like jelly , it is definitely not panna cotta .	3.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Tried this place due to a friend 's recommendation and I 'm glad I did . I really like the ambience of the place , though it can be a bit crowded at times . However , they make up for that by having plenty of outside seatings . I like their royal milk tea and their tiramisu is also delicious . Their popcorn chicken isn 't bad either . My sister tried their mango slush and she really liked it .	5.0	business

1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	We come here every time we go to Vegas . Best smoothies place in Las Vegas ! I can 't think of a better place to get a delicious mango smoothie with honey bobba after a long Hot day in Vegas or on the strip . If it doesn 't come out how you expect it , they will gladly fix it up for you so you 're happy . You 'll be able to relax and Play some Uno with friends to finish the night great or spend a nice afternoon.There 's isn 't much for food , but they do have a few " side " items , their bulgogi fries are awesome !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	LOVE THIS TEA PLACE ! everyone here is so nice and friendly and they have an amazing array of drinks . My favorites are the Peach-Lychee and Panda Milk tea ! It 's a great environment to hang it and play games with your friends !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I came here suddenly before they were open . The weather was so super windy and chilly outside that I was not willing to go where else . I asked them if I could come in to wait until they opened , and they said yes , which really pleased my heart . I mean , they very welcomed customer no matter what opening hours it was . Nice place , nice employees and delicious drinks . Highly recommend ! ! !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Great teas here . Parkin can be difficult to find on a weekend though . I came here with some friends for the first time and we sat on the patio outside . On the inside it appears that they have a gaming system set up that you can play . I guess it 's an attempt to get you to stay around longer	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	This is a great place to hangout and have fun with friends and family . The staff are nice and of course the desserts , boba taste delicious & affordable . I would definitely recommend this place to everyone !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I 've only had one boba shop that I liked going to for bulgogi fries , but now that I 've tried Tea of Joy 's bulgogi fries , I will definitely be coming here more often ! And for awhile , I 've constantly tried to find a good peach and lychee mix drink , and I 've found it ! Their Peach-chee with chia seeds drink is so refreshing ! The amount of games that they have available make it more family oriented and it 's great . Since it 's summer now , the seats they have outside are nice to comfortably sit on with your friends or family : )	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Love this place . Great place to hang out . Awesome games to play . Love their drinks and food selection ... the bulgogi fries are a must . They are open late too .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Had the Thai tea creme brûlée . It was ok . Different but not a good solid texture , more mushy . Nothing earth shattering . Same with the boba tea . Boys had taro slushies with boba and said they like Tea Time 's better . Hubs had the green Thai milk tea with Boba which he really liked but tasted just like Jasmine tea to me . Based on the environment ... Nice , cute . But inside is noisy and literally filled with kids . Good space outside but that 's where all the cigarette smokers go . And there are a lot . A constant flow of them . Boo .	3.0	business

They were really happy to makeup till my friends like them , that was the good services , they weren 't not angry or anything . They have played good music too . Just in case , if you dont like smoke or race cars , dont come at night time .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I just discovered this place when I was recently in Vegas and it is now my go to Boba joint when I 'm in town ! Ample parking , great service and great drinks .

Where have this place been all my life ? ? ? !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	On my breaks from my espresso hobbie I lean on my tea for comfort lol . Tea of Joy is more on the sweet side which is great when I am in the mood for boba . Their selection is great and ofcourse I went with the coffee milk tea ! It was good , was it great ? Hard to say , there is so much in Vegas to choose from but this day it was . Price is reasonable , place is clean , people were nice . It is worth checking out .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Excellent new place for boba / tea lovers like me ! ! Such a great location and the owner is so personable and nice !

Not to mention the cute interior !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Very disappointing . We went w 4 people so we all ordered different things so was able to try a bit of each . Quality of drinks was poor . Half of the cups were filled w ice and taste like water ! Service was equally bad . Lady at cash register was 9 month pregnant and had an attitude . Stick w Kung fu tea and tea station . Much betterTo be fair , the one good thing good about this place is that there is ample parking space and no lines as business is dead	1.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	The lack of customer care of the guy work there really have me push this place down to my second choice of boba place on spring mountain . Their drinks are good but that 's not just a part of building a successful business .	2.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Their flavors are very unique and their boba pearls are very soft and chewy . It is also a good place to go get together and study . My personal favorites are the Thai Tea and Vietnamese Iced Coffee .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	To begin , I really like the name of the store ! Creative .

I saw a huge brick toast on another table too it looked amazing . I would certainly recommend this place .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	We stumbled across this place after eating next door . Their decor is so beautiful and chic ! Their outdoor patio is huge . Lots of parking . Extremely clean . And they have games & a Playstation set up with really nice leather couches .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I would definitely give this place a 5 star but when I came in @ 12 : 30pm ( they open a 12 ) they had no boba ready it was still cooking when I got there . Also wanted to sit and have dessert but they were no macaroons available.Overall the tea I got tasted really really good .	4.0	business

1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I loved how they had durian-avocado smoothie ! It was just right , as you take your first sip you 're able to taste both fruits with boba . It 's been YEARS since I had durian , so I was quite ecstatic when I saw it on their menu . The staff were friendly , patient , and on point when a guest was ready to order . The design of the interior was appealing and made you want to hang around longer . My friends and I were there for almost 4 1 / 2 hours eating , catching up , and playing board games they provide .	5.0	business

1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	My go-to tea place ! Seriously one of the best places in town for drinks . They have a really extensive drink menu and toppings . Pea-chee is definitely my favorite . The food is really great also . Their bulgogi fries are to die for . The venue is just a really fun place to chill and hang out as well , from their board games and video games . Add the fact that they stay open later than most places is definitely a plus .	5.0	business

1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	This place was a hidden gem located in the back of a large plaza . I came here twice and was definitely impressed with the environment .

1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Ordered -royal sea salt-coffee milk tea-fruity pebble cheese cakeThe only thing I liked from here was the royal sea salt , it tasted like a standard milk tea topped with sea salt cream . Everything else was mediocre . The coffee milk tea didn 't taste anything like coffee so that sucked lol . The texture of the cheesecake reminded me of dried up play doh . It didn 't have any sweetness to it like the dessert should . It 's a cute hangout place but filled with a lot of young college students . Parking was easy , unlike most places in Chinatown .	3.0	business

1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	I really love it here , the atmosphere is great ! They have a great selection of teas , milk teas , smoothies and slushes . I really love their Green Thai milk tea , it has a nice floral taste to it and the macaroons are so cute and tasty ! They also have a small selection of snacks like popcorn chicken , sweet potato fries and more . Check this sweet spot out , you will definitely enjoy the vibe and the workers are really nice . This is my spot forsure !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	This place is great . When we walked in the people were very nice and accommodating . We ordered our drinks and they had a special for their milk and flavored teas . As we waited , the owner gave us free macaroons , which is very kind . The drinks ( taro smoothie and jasmine milk tea ) were both sweet and the tea was just right , which is what we like . They have high chairs , which I think I 'll use to study later on . It is very nice here , would recommend again LOL .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Awesome little tea lounge ! Checked this place out late at night with my boyfriend . They have an outside patio and the inside has plenty of seating . Very nicely decorated with an urban modern sort of feel . Really like the fact that they have a patio . Will be bringing my dog by to lounge outside while enjoying a milk tea : - ) I ordered a jasmine milk tea and my boyfriend ordered the dragon milk tea . Both amazing ! The staff were friendly , helpful and even gave us get samples to show us different options ! New favorite tea lounge .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Honestly one of my top favorite boba / tea places in town . I 'd say that their tea quality beats Brew Tea . But that 's just me . I highly recommend Green Thai Tea Milk Tea . I am addicted to those . The ambiance here is really social . It 's great for coming with a group just to play a few common board games to past time or relax a bit on their outdoor patio . They have an online stamp card app called Perka . For every 10 stamps , you 'll get a free classic milk tea or classic tea .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	My new favorite dessert place ! I ordered the honey toast box , a flan , and the bulgogi fries . It took awhile to receive my food but it was definitely worth the wait . I would recommend this place to everyone , they have so many foods and drinks to choose from .	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	Nice place to hang out with friends or family . They have some board games to play with . Their Thai Tea is really good . I tried their Tiramisu in a cute pot . It 's pretty good cause it 's not that sweet . Prices are very affordable .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	This place is great ! I really liked their strawberry milk tea with Bobba . I really recommend this place . It 's a good new place to try out !	5.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	We just came back here after a long time , it seemed like they changed the ownership . New decorations , just a little bit , new faces , no Asian cakes , no music . Drinks never been great but it 's not that bad . Once we tried the bulgogi Fries , we knew we loved it already , but this time it 's kinda saucy and sour , maybe they put over mayonnaise .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	This place is small but pretty cool with a fun atmosphere . Few card games , Jenga , and even video games available for customers . My tiramisu was good . The coconut coffee was too sweet so I only drank about half of it but it was a nice tasty treat . They were scrambling in the back because they were busy and maybe a little understaffed but overall it was good service . I 'll likely try them again sometime .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	{ Oct 23 , 2018 } Ambiance was chill & they had Lo-Fi Hip Hop playing . They also had plenty of games for you to play with your friends . I 'm glad they had the Wintermelon Milk Tea . Superb taste ! My only complaint is that guy that was helping us at the register had his arms crossed as his was answering our questions as it was our first time there . Who the hell does that ? As a Server , I thought that was a bit rude .	4.0	business
1bdwB6hxMUnSKF8bCsmuZA	The best regular milk tea ! They call it royal milk tea . Thai tea and oolang are also good and so are their fruit slushes . Jasmine is average , but the mexican drink with tamarind was not good at all . Love that they give samples for some teas . -1 because they are so slow its ridiculous . Each time Ive been here its taken pretty long to get my drink and it wasnt even busy . Overall , lots of drinks to choose from and great location . They have a patio which is nice . Macaroons are good but $ 2 each and they are rather small .	4.0	business
