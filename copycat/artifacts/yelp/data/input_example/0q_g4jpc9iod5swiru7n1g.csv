0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Watch out . Rented my car on Wednesday . Broke my right foot on Thursday and cannot drive . Wanted to get my wife on as an authorized driver . They can 't do anything over the phone . They gave me two options : 1 ) have my wife drive as an unauthorized driver to their rental location so that we can change it . We assume all the risk , 2 ) HANS the local manager told me to drive with my left foot.Surely I 'm not the first person that 's encountered a situation like this , yet this company makes it very difficult to do business with .	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	I was forced to buy insurance even though my credit card offers primary coverage . The man at the counter was very condescending and made me feel like I wouldn 't get a car unless I signed the agreement including insurance . My $ 63 rental became $ 190 ! I called Chase and they reversed the charged , and apologized for the way I was treated . How sad that a credit card company is apologizing on behalf of this company ! !	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	This is by far the worst rental company ever . The customer service Roger Shader was ride and incompetent . They deceived me on items I purchased and would not reimburse me . The car I initially was given and paid an upgrade for was fill with smoke and ashes .	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Poor service . The clerk at the desk was rude and apathetic . Her gestures were curt and not very personable , pointing fingers and ordering the next sale to come forward . She didn 't wear a name tag but we eventually heard her name was Renita . She tried selling additional services without giving us the price up front . We eventually learned It was an additional $ 70 dollars charge for a second driver . All in all , it wasn 't a pleasant experience . Honestly , a little enthusiasm and a friendly smile can go a long way . I hope our next experience will be more enjoyable .	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	This place isn 't a rip off . I booked a midsize and they only have 2 vehicles to choose from . I ask the lady in the garage how much for a size up and she said $ 20 more per day . She told the lady before me $ 20 total but me $ 20 a day . My car had ants , it was dirty and basic . $ 67 for a Nissan Sentra ! Never again .	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Jennifer was outstanding . She is an asset to this company and was very quick to explain everything . She even gave me instructions on how to get to my destination .	5.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Considering the other negative reviews , I was admittedly a bit nervous about renting from Dollar . My experience , however , was positive . The price was reasonable , the vehicle was clean , and I had no problems with the process . I appreciated that those working at the desk did not try to up sale by repeatedly " recommending " upgrades and additional services as many other car rental companies have in the past . The line moved a bit slowly when we picked up the car , but it was fairly busy .	4.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	The worst car rental company . That 's all . Just because you reserve a car a month ahead of time is no guarantee you will have a car when your flight arrives . We waited over an hour with no information until suddenly someone appeared and asked us to follow them . What a joke !	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Is negative stars an option ? There are HUNDREDS of ROACHES in the rental car I just picked up .... Only saw them once the dome light came on as I was unpacking my bags . Filthy nasty and never again	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Very unhappy with their services . They gave us a rental with paint on the passenger 's seat . My dress got ruined and I had to drive with a towel draped over the seat the whole 10 days we had the car . When I called the customer care number , they were very unhelpful and did not want to help in any way . Never renting from them again and will spread the word about their unprofessional services . Unhappy customer . They don 't even deserve one star .	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	When I reserve a car for 2pm , and they make me wait an hour after I arrive at 3 , it doesn 't work for me . What is the point of renting a car ? I should have taken a bus . This is the third time Dollar has done this to me . Never again .	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Very poor customer service . Gas cap was jammed shut . Couldn 't fill tank . Customer service said no problem tell manager when returning and I won 't get charged the gas fill fees . Ladies in return lane also found gas door jammed shut . Manager Soneh Davis forced it open over approx 40 min and then forced me to pay the fill fees . If I had forced it open I would have been charged damages . Do not rent from them ! !	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Check your paperwork ! I declined the extra insurance and the gas fill up and they added it anyway . When I tried to get it adjusted they told me too bad I had already signed it . So they charge me an extra $ 179 for three days ! And they don 't even have a direct number to reach them when you have an issue .	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Criminal extortion organization . DO NOT RENT FROM DOLLAR . I don 't have time to go in to the details of what happened , but basically my quote was $ 146 and they charge me for $ 500 . Charges I said no to were put on the bill . I am going through my credit card company to try to charge this back and dispute it . Repeat : DO NOT RENT from Dollar and TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW NOT TO !	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Booked a car on line for $ 150 . I was asked if I wanted an upgrade to a mid-size ( Camry ) and the price doubled , which was ridiculous . I was also asked if I wanted high , medium or low insurance ? Bogus question , as if you have car insurance , no additional insurance is needed . The question was misleading . Would never book with Dollar again .	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	I was concerned about renting with all the bad reviews but have to say I had a positive experience . Everyone was pleasant and working to get ppl in and out . They didn 't have what we reserved but gave us a chance to look over what they had that would work and upgraded us with no problem to a much nicer vehicle ( reserved a truck got suburban ) . Yes they will try to up sell you but that is like any company when you rent a vehicle . All in all pleased . Itemized bill with expectations explained etc .	5.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Why 5 stars ... I also travel frequently . My reservations weren 't messed up , I got the car I reserved on the biggest NASCAR weekend , my flight was delayed for several hours due to weather and guess what ? ... they didn 't give my car reservtion to someone else . Yes , the woman behind the counter walked us to the car lot ( an act not usual in the car rental business ) , they have been moved from thier usual location to a tempory location until the constuction at the airport is complete ; therefore , they are assisting their costomers through the complete mess at the airport and surrounding streets .	5.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Rudest employees ever ! The lady at the front desk was totally disinterested , then the woman in the booth was flat out rude and nasty . Keep your cars , I am going elsewhere . If an employee can 't even be bothered to point me in the right direction of my car without being nasty , they suck and so does your company . What a pathetic excuse for service and to the woman in the booth , your a sorry excuse for a human being !	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Scams customers . Dont rent from this company . They have a lot of hidden fees . Charged $ 25 extra for bringing the car back 1 day early , and was told that you had to get gas within 10 miles of the airport when you brought the car back.workers are rude including the manager .	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	Turned in prepaid rental today.the agent that rented it me filled out the form to accept insurance even though I declined.my fault came in on a red eye and did not pay attention.watch the agent I don 't think they pay attention either.or it is something they are trained to do to increase the bottom line	1.0	business
0q_g4jpc9iod5swiru7n1g	I would like to add that this garbage business contacted me , but once i sent all of my info , no further contact . Why am i mot surprised ?	1.0	business
