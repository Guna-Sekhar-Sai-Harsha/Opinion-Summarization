1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	Was craving some Cuban food like in Miami and found this place online . It 's pretty darn close to Miami style Cuban food and mehn those large portions ! Yes or like the Cubans say it " Oye " ' ! Had the pork chunks with white rice and red beans on the side with Tostones and salad . The pork chucks were large and succulent . The rice and beans were cooked well and the Tostones ... oh how I missed Tostones ! Fried perfectly golden and not too done . The young girl at the desk is very friendly and hospitable . I will be back again !	4.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	I just discovered this place yesterday and I 'm obsessed . Their meals are delicious and cheap . They offer a whole meal for $ 7 ! They charge $ 1 for a piece of flan , which is also great . I 'm so used to Cuban food being so expensive , it 's great to know that places like this exist . They run out of food quickly , so you gotta get there early . I tried going at 6 : 30 and all they had were tamales left .	4.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	Best Comido Cubano I 've had in Las Vegas , the Ropa Vieja is marvelous and well spiced , the black beans and white rice are perfect compliments , don 't forget the fried plantains , a simple small hole in the wall place in a strip mall , family run , great home cooking , pork , beef , chicken , and the service is impeccable , a must try before it gets too well known , which won 't be long	5.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	Omg ! Bomb.com ! Love how they have it completa style which means great portions at cheap prices ! East coast style ! ! I had lechon asado with congri and side salad and plantano maduro for 7.00 .. plus I had mamey batido which was perfect to taste not too sweet and chilled . Plus my company had cuban sandwich and other completas like pollo frito and picadillo with white rice and black beans . They said is delicious as well .. I had to travel from North town which is quite a distance but worth the travel for a delicious hearty meal .	5.0	business

1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	Great price for a big plate . However food was not hot , it came to me cold . Not a very good experience . Also not to flavorful the food was missing spices .	3.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	This place has very good pricing . You come in thinking it 's going to be good authentic food , but everything comes out super cold like it 's literally been sitting for the whole morning with absolutely no flavor .	1.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	I have recently found a craving for Cuban Food and I am glad a friend took me to EL Tinajon . This is very much a family owned restaurant with a simple menu and small eating area . I have gotten several things from the menu and have tried the Cuban Tamales and all have been great tasting . The speed of the food is quick and the staff and customer inside are al nice and which make this place inviting .	4.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	Excellent food ! The Cuban sandwich was great and the lunch special was a perfect way to taste different Cuban foods . Tons of great food and super affordable !	5.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	It 's hard to fine Cuban food in Vegas with authenticity . Definitely this is the right spot . Roasted Pork and Cuban Tamales has the real taste . Simply love it ! Only thing they need to improve is supply . This is not Cuba ! You can 't running a business with shortage . If you ask for something in the menu should be there	4.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	This is the ONLY authentic Cuban food myCuban wife and I have ever had in Vegas and we have tried them all . The only reason I didn 't give 5 stars is because they messed up my order . I ordered Vaca Frita but got Ropa Vieja but the ropa vieja was so good I didn 't send it back ; - ) . Good food , good price and the restaurant is clean .	4.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	Great food I will come again . I ordered Ropa Vieja with rice black beans , green salad and tostones . AMAZING ! finally we are having Cuban food here which is one of the best Latin food ever . We should have more of this than disgusting Mexican food .	5.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	Terrible place ... no prices on menu .. in fact no menu except what 's written on board . I ordered chicken , rice and bean combo and plantains ... all were tasteless ... the place is a far cry from la 's Versailles ... and it 's dirty to boot .. Not good , barely acceptable ...	2.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	They say they close at 7 they do not they close at 6 : 30 we tried to order to go pickup but they said they are closed . Why do they say at 7 when it 's not at 7 ? Not a huge fan of restaurants that lie	1.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	First time here with a friend . I wanted to order a sandwich Cubano but they were not serving it or they ran out of it . So I ordered the tamales . Since everyone kept ordering them . With the rice and beans . It didn 't take long for the food to come out . Everything was fresh and good . There 's big chunks of chicken in the tamales . They 're not expensive either everything is pretty much reasonable . The rice was good as well . There 's a cool mural of Cuba , and great music to enjoy with your food .	4.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	Due to the fact of being Cuban , coming from Miami , living there for 32 years . I will definitely know how Cuban food taste and looks . Today Halloween day at 2 : 43 I am siting right now on the table 10 / 31 / 2017 , all I can say is that my steak was cook from the previous day or from another customer . I had two pieces of steak on my plate one was fresh and the other one wasn 't . I couldn 't eat it .	1.0	business

1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	Some of the best Cuban food here in Las Vegas , other than going to my Tia Andreas house but your not invited there so this will do for you guys lol . I 've tried the tamales which are made of corn and stuffed with ham . Definitely should try ropa vieja ( old clothes ) it 's shredded steak with tomato sauce very flavorful , served with congris ( rice mixed with black beans ) , yuca with onions and a salad . Everything I 've tried is very delicious and reasonable prices .	5.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	Wish this place was closer to me ! For the cost of a fast food combo ( $ 7 ) , you can get a fresh ingredient meal consisting of a meat ( choices including steak , fried chicken , shredded beef ) , salad , rice , beans and a side ( i.e. , plantains , yuca ) . Service was fast and friendly . Our take-out order included delicious croquetas de jamon ( 4 for $ 3 ) , a sizeable steak sandwich ( $ 6 included fries ) and a entree with masitas de puerco . All was excellent !	4.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	Yes , you need to go here . I don 't know who you are but that doesn 't matter . El Tinajon is a place everyone should eat at . Authentic Cuban food at its , well , most authentic- which means delicious . Ham & cheese croquettes ? Yes , they have them and they 're divine . Fried pork ? Also divine . Everything pork - delicious goodness . Stop by , give it a try and I 'm sure you won 't be disappointed .	4.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	In my opinion this is , by far , the worst Cuban food in Las Vegas . If this place were in Miami , IMO , they would go broke in less than 3 months ! Intheir favor ( cheap prices ) . NOT in their favor : location , d√©cor , selections , presentation , andflavorless food . I guess the adage " you getwhat you pay for " fits this place perfectly !	1.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	On a second and third visit to El Tinajon I found thatthe Cuban meals were much better and tastier thanon my first visit . Whereas previously I had rater thiseatery a ( 1 ) , upon my 2nd visit I Upgraded it to a ( 3 ) .On my 3rd and last visit this past week I liked it more , where I now give it a weak 4 ( a HUGE improvementfrom my first visit ) . I now rate highly their tamales , ropa vieja , mamey shakes , and bistek encebollado .	4.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	Listen , it 's a hole in the wall . Is it as good as my mom 's cooking ? Can anyone 's cooking be better than my mom 's ? Nope , but the food is good , and the tamales are delicious . If you 're craving Cuban food , this is the place to be . I drive all the way from the north west to come here .	4.0	business
1_eNhr53_bTPy11vvVL4Hw	El Tinajon was very good at the beginning for me . However , the l last two visits , the order was horrendous . I used to order the steak , but after the last order , I stopped . The steak was dry with no flavor . I decided to give the restaurant another try . Today , I ordered rice / beans and pork , the pork had no flavor , the black beans was watery and again , no flavor . I don 't think I will be going back .	1.0	business
