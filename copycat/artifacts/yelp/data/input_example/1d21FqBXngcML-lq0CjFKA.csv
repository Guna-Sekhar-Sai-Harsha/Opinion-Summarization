1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	I want to thank Fernando and the guys at Clean & Neat Auto for an exceptional job ! My Jeep Sahara spends a large deal of time riding around ( with 4 Labrador Retrievers ) in the clay & mud of New Mexico . In reality , never really thought it was possible to clean the mud and dog hair out . But these guys did it ! They even fixed the scratches along the body . GREAT job ! My hubby made a follow up appointment , for his truck this week . VERY HAPPYSent from my iPad	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	We contracted them in 8 / 15 / 2017 to detail our van and sedan ahead of a major family event . They were able to fit us in the very next day . They were super responsive and while they were not the cheapest , they were the most thorough . Would definitely recommend without reservation .	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	Best detail I have ever had . Oscar and his coworker were amazing !

They are the only company I will ever use from now on !	5.0	business

1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	These guys were able to make a crunch schedule happen right before the holiday ! They were even able to show up a little earlier than scheduled . When they were done , i walked out and literally said " WOW ! ! ! " I take pride in my truck and was quite pleased with the turnout . I will use them again	5.0	business

1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	I 'm extremely impressed with Clean & Neat . After overpaying for less than perfect work , I finally found these guys . I am super picky when it comes to my car . Luckily Joey and Andrew do phenomenal work . Friendly , great prices and they usually accommodate last minute service . I can 't recommend this detailer enough . Give Joey and Andrew a raise ! They deserve it .	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	I was really impressed with the job they did ; they came to my apartment and fully detailed my car in an hour . Can 't ask for much more .	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	I used Clean & Neat for the first time the morning of 2 / 21 / 17 . I needed a simple wash and vacuum as a test of their service . Fernando ( The owner ) along with Henry arrived right on time to wash my 2017 Ford Escape . They did a fantastic job . Windows perfect , check . Tires and wheels perfect , check . Interior perfect , check . I would highly recommend Fernando and his crew to clean your ride . I was very impressed ! ! ! ! ! !	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	No call no show for my appointment . I waited several hours for them , wasting my day off . I left several voicemails with no phone call back . I tried calling for a few days after that to see what happened and try to reschedule , but they never answer the phone . Looks like I 'm not the first & only to experience this kind of bad customer service judging by previous reviews . No communication from them since . I don 't know how one can run a profitable business like this.I would not recommend using ( or at least trying to use ) C & N.	1.0	business

1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	I had two cars get a full interior and exterior detail simultaneously , and in less than 3.5 hours both cars were immaculate . The guys do a great job , and the prices are incredibly affordable . Best of all , they come to you . Very highly recommended !	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	Joey and Andrew came to my home to detail my two cars and they did an amazing job ! They went above and beyond to help me with some damage claims through a car rental app and to help me with some more issues I had with my car . Their customer service was excellent , they kept me up to date with their progress , and they were very great overall . The end result of the detailing for both cars was amazing and I couldn 't be happier . Both of our cars look brand new . I would definitely recommend Clean & Neat to anyone needing their car detailed !	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	I just moved to Arizona from Washington and had never heard of mobile detailing . I found Clean and Neat from high Yelp reviews and very reasonable prices !

1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	I called and made an appointment with them and they said they would arrive between 8am-9am . They called and said they were outside at 8 : 30 . Very professional and made me feel like my car was in good hands . I just got my car and purchased it used and the leather seats were absolutely trashed . Once these guys were done , the seats and everything else looked brand new ! Not to mention , they cleaned my headlights and I couldn 't believe how good it looked . I will be recommending them to all of my friends and family . I already made another appointment next week for another one of my vehicles !	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	I booked this appointment online , they showed up on time exactly as they 'd said . I was sorta shocked , like most other people I expected them to be late because that 's what I 'm used to . When I looked at the truck when he wad finished I was shocked again , looked brand new inside and out . This was the best and easiest process , will use again .	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	Top notch is an understatement for these guys . I waited a week to post a review to see if anything would come about after the detail and even my fender walls are still darker than from the factory . Definitely using heir expertise again in the future . Thanks Fernando ! ! ! ! ! On top of the detailing , they could even come to your house for a weekly wash .

1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	just drove the car in the daytime , these guys were trying to get done too quick , front and side windows smeared , dash still has dust on it and you can see where they wiped it and missed dust . Overall nice job but a little sloppy here and there	4.0	business

Definitely hiring them for all future interior cleaning . Thank you so much for your hard work , it is appreciated .	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	I researched several car detailing companies and liked the detailing packages that Clean And Neat offered . Fernando and his two employees came out and went right to work . What was most impressive is that they bring their own water and generators vs using your water and electricity . Overall , very happy with the way things look . Will certainly use them again	5.0	business

1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	I contacted Clean & Neat first thing in the morning for an urgent interior cleaning after an unfortunate sick child incident . They were able to have someone out to my work and cleaning my car about 4 hours after I initially contacted them . They were fast and efficient and did a solid job of cleaning up the interior . Oscar was personable and completely professional throughout . I will definitely be using them again . I would recommend Clean & Neat to anyone looking to get their car cleaned !	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	My car looks brand new ! I 'd forgotten how good the interior could look . They did such a great job . They showed up to my house on time , took their time and did it right .

Never going anywhere else for mobile detailing . I instantly love my car again . Thank you ! ! !	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	My husband and I went here and we got great customer service .

Great place great location glad we went here .	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	I sent a message through Yelp early in the morning and Fernando replied to me very quickly . I needed a same day appointment and as luck would have it , he got a cancelation and was able to come . He arrived with professional supplies and two additional staff who were also friendly and they got right to work . My car ( mobile garbage can on wheels ) was terribly dirty and you should see it now ! It 's amazing . We are heading to the dealership to trade it in and the car looks great !	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	Clean and Neat came to my workplace in the morning , found my parking spot faster than I usually can , and texted me they were ready to start . After a few hours I came back to a completely different car . The guys removed 4 years of kid-gunk - goldfish crackers , sand from the playground , crumbs , legos - and made it look like new again . Better , actually since now it has protection on it . The di-ionized water dries without any residue , so this car is as clean as it gets . Highly , HIGHLY recommended . Best price , too .	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	We have used this car cleaning and detailing service several times and they consistently do a great job . Scheduling appointments is super easy online .

We will definitely continue to use their service !	5.0	business

1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	My car looks a thousand times better ! I 'll definitely have Henry come out again soon . Thank you for going the extra mile to do an amazing job ! ! !	5.0	business
1d21FqBXngcML-lq0CjFKA	I was expecting a little more work from them for what I paid . The car had some water stains from the sprinklers but they said that they were not able to eliminate those . The rest of the job was ok	3.0	business
