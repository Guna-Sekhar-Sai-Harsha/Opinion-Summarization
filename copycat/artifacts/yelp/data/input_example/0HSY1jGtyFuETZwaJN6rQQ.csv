0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	I wouldn 't suggest dining in . It seems like they don 't use their air conditioner and the place feels hot and swampy even during winter time . The street hippies in the area are in and out , and parking is a bit tight since it shares the lot with quite a few other businesses . Someone suggested to order their # 3 " Hunan Special Chicken . " It was just okay , but you get a big portion for the price which deserves a + 1 star .	3.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	If you feel like Chinese this place is definitely better and better prices than Panda . It does take awhile for them to make your food so I would call ahead of time even when no ones there but their spicy chicken , lemon shrimp , pork is always awesome with fried rice . Normally I don 't like lo mein but theirs has just enough sauce and tastes so fresh .	4.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Outstanding food . The Lo mein shrimp and snow peas are to die for . The won ton soup is tasty along with the appetizers of deep fried shrimp , won ton wrappers and eggrolls . The Hunans are very generous with their dipping sauces . Im proud to serve Hunans to my out of state relatives and friends .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	If you do not want food poisoning , then do not eat here . The person I was with had to call out of work at 2 AM due to vomiting for a half hour straight from take out . I will never order from this place ever again . Save yourself the money , sleep and hopefully your stomach .	1.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Food is amazing . I 'm outside the delivery area , but it is worth the drive . They make the egg foo young wonderful ( where they put everything on top and not inside ) The Moo Shoo Pork is a family favorite , but they do run out at times ( it 's that good ) Hot and sour sizzling rice soup and the sesame chicken are some other favorites . A definite family run business they make common human errors , but always correct it and are always friendly when face to face .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	I just had Egg-drop Soup and an Egg Roll but both were tasty . It 's a hardy Egg Soup though ( I 'm a fan of brothier soups myself ) , with lots of carrots , peas , celery , bamboo , and water chestnuts . A little busy for my taste as far as Egg-drop goes but it was good and had the right consistency . The Egg Roll was meaty with that spiced sausage . Really enjoyed it.Lunch specials are good quantities and good prices , but I cant speak on their flavor . Otherwise , it 's what you 'd expect of a hole-in-the-wall Chinese place .	3.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Ewwww dude ... This wasn 't very good . After taking well over an hour to deliver food on a Thursday night .. It was cold , soggy , and not appetizing . I ordered the sesame chicken , which was really sweet and sour chicken sprinkled with sesame seeds . The crab puffs were soggy and under cooked . The only things thought was decent was the egg fried rice . I have yet to find a decent delivery place in tempe , and this makes me sad : (	2.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	I 've been coming here for about 7 / 8 years now and it 's one of the BEST Chinese restaurants in Tempe . It 's affordable and the amount of food you get is so worth it . I always get the Hunan Special Chicken and it 's never a disappointment . The house fried rice is good too as well as the crab puffs . The couple that owns it is so friendly ! They know my family and I because we 're loyal customers and every time we go in with the kids they always give us a big bag of fortune cookies , who can say no to that ? !	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	The Hunan special chicken is always great . The menu says that it spicy , but it 's usually not which is fine . The white rice is always fluffy and delicious . Crab puffs are divine . Although they 're sweet and sour dipping sauce is not the best it 's somewhat thin and water down . They always remember to include lots of soy sauce napkins and forks as well as spicy mustard and fortune cookies . Do deliveries very fast and their prices are reasonable . Have ordered from them several times and Im never disappointed . The lemon chicken chicken is tasty too .	4.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Found this place back when i was a student at Al Collins Graphic Design . Best Chinese Food in Tempe . You get a huge portion for the price , and everything is oh so good . Best mom and pop Chinese cuisine around .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	The Best I 've fond outside of New Jersey ! The best ! To find food this Good this far from the East Coast is awesome ! Feels like home .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Good food - I ordered beef broccoli and lemon chicken ( the lemon chicken was deep-fried which I wasn 't expecting , but it was alright ! I 'd order these again ) . The deep-fried wontons were great and the egg roles were some of the best I 've had ( not slimy on the inside like many places I 've been to ) . I ordered delivery and it took 1h 10mins to get here : ( but it came HOT so I was okay with that : )	4.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Hunan Chicken is amazing , fried chicken mixed with chinese cuisine . Couldn 't eat everything unfortunately as they have large portions , but the food was excellent . Not something I would 've gone to if it weren 't for recommendations . Glad I am always up to try new things because this was excellent .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	One day I walked in and noticed the cook sitting in the dinning area , while I waited to order I notice him dig in his nose , then walk back to the kitchen and didnt wash his hands , I wasnt sure so I walked around to the kitchen to peek in and I was right ... I then told the owner and his wife and they made him wash his hands . I walked out .... will not be back .	1.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Couldn 't even finish the meal it was so terrible . Got the sesame chicken and it had very little flavor , was chewy , and was full of what I 'm pretty sure were the tendons . The side of fried rice was just rice , saw maybe three peas in the whole side and nothing else . There are much better options for Chinese food in Tempe , look elsewhere for lunch or dinner .	1.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	So good ! I recommend the Hunan chicken combo . My girl friend loves the cream puffs . I have had some issues with deliveries , but overall this place is great .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	I love this place . Their salt and pepper pork isn 't on the menu , but it 's their Thursday daily special and you can order it any day of the week . The owners are always so nice , which makes me happy as a return customer .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Bleh . This place looks pretty rough , but it 's been here for a long time and I was thinking that the food must be pretty good if it 's survived that long . Wrong . I 'd say that at least half of my Hunan chicken & shrimp combo went in the trash . I could 've done better with Panda Express and I 'll be eating a bowl of Cap 'n Crunch in hour or two.Fortune cookie : Desire , like the atom , is explosive with creative force . In bed .	1.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Dude . I thought it was good . Hunan Special Chicken is similar to Orange Chicken but less syrupy . Vegetable Lo Mein had lots of vegetables . The order was cooked quickly and portions are very large - good value for the price .	4.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	This place is marvelous . Their special combos are only $ 7 and they are very friendly and quick . I 'd recommend anyone looking for a quick bite of tasty Chinese food to come to Hunan express . This place is my go-to Chinese restaurant .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Hands down the BEST crab puffs I 've ever had . I 'm comparing this to the many Chinese places I 've been to in San Francisco and LA and OMG it 's heavenly explosions of creamy cheesy fried goodness ! ! I 've had their fried race and it 's pretty delicious and they gave big portions . I 'm not sure why they 're not rated higher . I mean , this is a hole in the wall , not a fancy family restaurant or anything . Lack of ambiance , but it 's really cheap , good eats . Egg rolls are good too : )	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	First impressions last . So I 'm going to have another delivery from this place next time . And I 'm going to try the Hunan Chicken that everyone is saying , is good . I had Chicken Chopsuey and I thought it was very tasty - chicken is tender , sauce not bland , veggies are fresh . Delivery is abou 45 minutes but IMO worth it .	4.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	I just got delivery from this place because I heard positive reviews about their food . This food is delicious ! ! It 's very hard to find food Chinese food . The low mein and orange chicken is awesome along with the chicken fried rice . The delivery lady was so sweet and courteous as well . The food was so hot when it got here too . Definitely ordering from here from now on . : ) I wish I would have found it sooner !	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Not even the fortune cookie was good ! I paid about $ 8 for rice and vegetables . My egg drop soup consisted of Campbell 's soup . That 's it . I mean , this place reminds me I really need to take up cooking because , I just got robbed . The only reason I have it two stars is because it 's local . Other than that , I came here to eat rice , peanuts , and Campbell 's soup . Dammit !	2.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Pretty close to the best crab puffs I have ever had . The delivery was supposed to take 30 minutes according to what they quoted me , it took 60 minutes . The chicken was soggy and dry , overcooked chicken with under fried breading . I asked them to make it " extra , extra , extra , extra , super duper spicy. as spicy as you can make it " and it was the most bland tasting breaded chicken I have had and not even close to spicy . The lo mien was spicier than the GT 's chicken.I would go back if I only wanted crab puffs but that 's it .	2.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Although Hunan express took our delivery order 20 minutes before they closed , the food was half an hour late ( after their 35 minute delivery estimate ) . The food was amazingly crappy . I ordered the Bok Choy Chicken , which was almost decent . My boyfriend ordered the Orange Chicken , which definitely made me want to throw up , first bite . Both were hugely lacking flavor .	1.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Not impressed at all ! Rice is under cooked , crab puffs were inconsistent ; either huge and super cheesy , or a tiny folded crisp . Shrimp tasted weird . The delivery guy kind of spilled the sauce so the bottom of the bag was drenched . Delivery speed was mediocre . Don 't think I 'll order from here again unless I 'm desperate .	1.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Love their food and hands down the best eggrolls I 've ever had . For a while there I was buying them by the dozen . Wish they delivered to Chandler .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Ordered delivery to the hotel and it came earlier than expected . It 's hot and delicious . It 's also filled to the top . An order for one can feed 3 people . I 'm so happy I took a chance on them not knowing the area . I 'll remember and order again when I 'm the area .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Don 't order here unless you have TWO hours to wait for delivery . This " restaurant " is affiliated with GrubHub and they don 't even bother notify them of delays . After several calls with GrubHub I called Human Express and was told " We very busy ! " I am HAPPY a little business is doing so well . Our food finally arrived literally two hours later without any apology . " Adequate food " is generous . If you are wanting quick delivery this isn 't it !	1.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	My boyfriend and I went to Hunan after trying a few chinese places in Chandler . When we called the lady didnt speak very good english so we knew this place would be authentic . It definately was authentic ! ! ! We are very very satisfied with everything ! Ive uploaded some pictures we ordered 3 combos and 2 sides . Cheap , Huge amounts ( as shown in pictures ) and service was kind and satifactory .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	The food was very good American Chinese food and the owners were very nice . I can read chinese so I 'd appreciate knowing the names if dishes in Chinese before i ordered .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	I love this place ! The absolute best deal for your money ! The prices reasonably and surprisingly low for the amount of food you Get ! I can 't believe I just found them when they have been in business over 20 years !	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	The first time I went here , I had a decent meal . I had the Hunan special chicken and it wasn 't bad . I visited again today and was very disappointed . I had the sweet and sour chicken combo today . The egg roll and wontons were okay . I believe I can make better hot and sour soup . The chicken was of very poor quality . I bit into a bad piece with gristle and cartilage . It wasn 't as crispy as I like it either . I won 't be going here again .	1.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Not pretending to be anything that it 's not . The owner and perhaps two of his family members we 're more than a trifle stunned when I said that I would be eating in the establishment .	3.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Very crispy General Tso 's chicken , big servings , and reasonable prices . Take out was fresh and hot , I 'll be back ... wasn 't crazy about crab puffs tho	4.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Made the mistake of ordering some soup from these clowns using Grub Hub . So , an hour later the delivery guy ( some kid ) knocks on the door with the soup , but he doesn 't have any change for a twenty . So , I tell the kid that when he 's making deliveries he needs to have change for a twenty , and you what the kid tells me ? He says ; " GO F * CK YOURSELF " and walks aways with the soup . NIce .....	1.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Ordered party trays for company party yesterday for 70 + people . Nothing but great service from here . From delivery on time to lots and lots of food ! We even have a lot extra to feed additional 20 + people . Price is very reasonable . Will definitely order more in the future !	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	I hate leaving disappointing reviews . The food was bland and not worth the $ 20 I paid . It took about 1 hour and 15 minutes for the food to arrive and I live 3 miles down the road . Kung Pao chicken was not spicy and bland , pepper beef had absolutely no flavor and didn 't look great when it arrived , and egg drop soup was more like chicken noodle soup and did not have the same flavor I 'm used to . I was craving Chinese food but I was pretty disappointed when it arrived . The delivery guy was super sweet though so I feel bad about the negative review .	2.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Love the food . The freshest time to go is between the hours of 4-6 . After that I had a couple of run ins with not so fresh chicken . The sweet and sour chicken is my highest recommended dish . I	4.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	You know what ! ? I have been going to this hole-in-the-wall Chinese take-out place for about 10 years now and its time to give it its due . I have pretty much only ordered one dish because there is no reason to order anything else here ..... The Hunan Chicken . In the 10 years some things have remained very constant : 1 . The owner is very friendly and is always working . 2 . This dish is always consistent and tasty. and 3 . They are very quick and cheap . What more is there ? I 'm going 5-star just based off of that .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	We have been dining here for about a handful of years . More often than not , this mum and pop shoppe 's been consistent with delivering great customer service ... And food that are tastier than Panda Express ! No . This place is not perfect for everybody . However , this works for us - price , location , customer service , consistency , and food variety ! ^ _ ^	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	Very good place to eat .. I go here atleast 3 times a week and the owners are very good people , they always interact with their customers . I pretty much know the owners and everytime I go there they already know what I want . I highly recommend this place .	5.0	business
0HSY1jGtyFuETZwaJN6rQQ	I ordered food off of grubhub , and it was suppose to arrive almost 30minutes ago and they forgot my drink I called to ask where it was the person who answered male was rude and hung up after he hurriedly said they 're on way . And the male who delivered couldn 't seem to be bothered before I could ask for my drink he ran back into his very expensive mustang where someone was waiting for him . I am astounded	1.0	business
