0yRwx_s94WIC0mmc6qVUyQ	I absolutely love this place . The waitresses are so sweet and attentive . The owner was a sweetheart and checked up on us to make sure everything was okay . I came here for two birthdays in a row and will continue to do so . The place is gorgeous .	5.0	business
0yRwx_s94WIC0mmc6qVUyQ	I came on a slow night and didn 't try any of the food . The music was good , the layout was great and I like the comfortable couches . But watch out for the prices , drinks can get expensive if you 're not paying attention . Overall great experience and highly recommended .	4.0	business
0yRwx_s94WIC0mmc6qVUyQ	Music is good , the spot looks awesome and the girls are attentive but the hookah sucks , it not only taste bad but they probably don 't clean it as often as they should . The drinks are watered down ; I had the mojito , mostly tasted like club soda with cheap vodka AND the mints were brown : ( oh ! and it was completely empty on a Saturday night at 1am ! ! ! I 'd suggest beer only ! Or just another spot in all .	1.0	business
0yRwx_s94WIC0mmc6qVUyQ	I picked this place , among all the near by place to my home , but it turned out it was wrong choice . The reviews were good on Google and here , thought of giving a try . But , not worth of traveling all the way to this place ( it was like 25 kms from my home ) This place was locked down on monday night , when all the other places were atleast half busy . The phone number listed is not working . Not sure even this place exist in real ? Looks like deserted place from outside . Won 't recommend to travel all the way to this place and then returning fail .	1.0	business

0yRwx_s94WIC0mmc6qVUyQ	Upscale shisha upscale located in wood bridge west of Toronto . Used to be La Fanouse . Great environment and good shisha . Not the best though . Service is not bad too and they have variety of food and drinks selections .	3.0	business
0yRwx_s94WIC0mmc6qVUyQ	Great atmosphere and music is up to date . But the servers and owners are snobby and they expect a nice tip on top of gratuity ! ? ? lol nah . All of them need to clean their act up . Stop chilling in the corners of the place and serve and be attentive to your customers . Smh	2.0	business
0yRwx_s94WIC0mmc6qVUyQ	Very decent place ... the food and music was amazing .. very good customer service ... this is one of the rare places were you won 't find anything to complain about . Good Job Guys .	5.0	business
0yRwx_s94WIC0mmc6qVUyQ	The shisha in itself was decent , but the service is sub-par , if not at times completely absent but that 's probably my fault for always coming at extremely busy hours whenever I 'm in the area . The vibe is heaps of fun ! Drinks are a little expensive , haven 't yet tried any of their food so can 't comment on that .	3.0	business
0yRwx_s94WIC0mmc6qVUyQ	Been there twice very good atmosphere security is professional staff is prompt . Did not try all the food but their wings are pretty good . It 's a chill place tvs you can watch games it is a Shisha Lounge . Saturdays they do have a dj only reason I gave it a 4 if you are going to have amazing DJ 's you do need a dance floor : - ( . Booths are amazing and very big , perfect place to do a birthday if you are not into club scene but still would love to enjoy and listen to some good music . They do have an nice patio will check it out next time .	4.0	business
0yRwx_s94WIC0mmc6qVUyQ	Couldn 't get in on a Saturday at 11 pm because all the tables were in use ... We asked if there is a wait list for a table and a time what we can come back for and they told us no , we have to wait till a table decides to leave .... so with that being said during peak hours on the weekend there should be a table sit time so you 're not just sitting waiting for maybe getting a table	1.0	business
