1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	Not a big fan of this pizzaiolo . I came here late at night so I guess you would not expect much but they only had one type of pizza at that time and it was old and not fresh at all . The place is small and it just for a quick to grab a bite . I would not suggest this place as i have better pizzaiolo from other once .	2.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	I had 2 slices of a vegan pizza with added vegan cheese . It was really good and tasty . My only critique is I think the restaurant could improve on its atmosphere . A lot of the tables weren 't wiped and the women 's toilet was clogged . But other than that , good food at a reasonable price .	3.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	They do vegan cheeeeeeeesee noooow praise Cheesus. sorry.Anyway , I 'm not much of a pizza person but I love theirs . My meat-eating roommates also say that the pizza they 've had here is the best they 've had . My dad eats here every time he 's in the city . They do seem to be confused about a few things , didn 't charge me one time for vegan cheese on a slice and then charged me the next time , but not a big deal , just confusing .	4.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	Pizzaiolo at 346 Bloor St is an Annex hot-spot . It is difficult to go about your business at Spadina and Bloor without being distracted by the wonderful smells coming from this ' hole-in-the-wall ' pizzeria . * * * LIFE HACK * * * Order a party-size pepperoni and add free rosemary , fresh chopped garlic , and oregano . WHILE YOU 'RE WAITING , go to PIZZA PIZZA at Bathurst for dipping sauce -- WE ALL KNOW THAT SHIT IS DOPE	4.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	Very good pizza , good price , good service , countless combinations . Not going to blow you away but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite if you 're craving pizza	4.0	business

1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	I have to say ... I 've ordered a few times from the location at Yonge and Eglington ... which was much better . This pizza had almost NOTHING on it . Toppings are so meagre I was shocked . Truly i 've never seen any pizza place deliver such a bad experience . ( I hope I can add a picture .. )	2.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	So I heard that pizzaiolo has vegan pizza , they do , but it was quite disappointing.It was a late night and i was hungry for a slice . The only vegan option that was available had zucchini and spinach for toppings . Now if you are going to serve vegan pizza then at least put some effort and use mock cheese , or maybe consider more palatable toppings . Regardless , the crust was not up to par.But it 's not like I had better options . I guess vegans can 't be choosers .	2.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	The search for good delivery pizza in our Annex neighbourhood was ongoing in my family , now that Pizza Gigi has become increasingly more inconsistent . Last night we ordered from Pizzaiolo - a large Mafioso pizza - and it was excellent . Fresh , tasty ingredients , fine crust , everything you 'd want in a pizza . We ordered online and the process was seamless . This is now our new pizzeria .	5.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	Wow . Stupid me . I have SUCH a terrible memory . I made the mistake of ordering from these guys again - and it was exactly the same experience . Nice pizza , but STUNNINGLY expensive for the MINUSCULE toppings you get.Dumb me just paid $ 70 for a pizza with WAY TOO little toppings on it.When am I going to learn ?	2.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	I have eaten at various pizzaiolo locations before , so when I was ordering for delivery I figure I 'd give them a try . When the delivery person showed up after about 45 minutes , she had forgotten to bring our salad , so she had to go back and get it . The pizza was OK , and when she returned another 45 minutes later with the salad , it was very basic . I was surprised that due to their error and poor service they never offered us any gift cards or reimbursement . I will not be ordering from them again .	2.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	Decent pizza for delivery while staying at the Hyatt . Had the Godfatherp , it was pretty tasty but the bacon was somewhat scarce . Delivery was pretty quick . Would have done more stars but they didn 't include a fork for my salad .	4.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	This place has ' nice ' pizza - but WAY overpriced . I just spent $ 60 on a pizza - and the number of toppings was VERY disappointing . I paid for lots of toppings - and I didn 't get much more than you do when you pay $ 5 for a medium take out pizza from Pizza Pizza .	3.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	I rather eat frozen pizza than return here . The service was very slow . The price is way too expensive for such low quality pizza . They say it 's fresh but the pizza slice I got was fairly stale .	1.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	Favourite pizza in toronto . My go to pizza is a meat lovers . It 's very rich in flavour . A tad expensive but I swear by this place .	5.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	I love the this place . They people who work here are amazing and they deliver great pizza with good quality and unique ( compared to other chains ) toppings . Yes pizza is more expensive than 241 / pizza pizza but they are that much better . Love them ( also love our local 241 )	5.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	This is the first Pizzaiolo I 've ever tried and the best ( don 't ask why ! ) . The pizza is made to perfection and the variety is great ! The Asian guy who works there ( sorry , don 't know his name ) is super friendly ! The place is my spot . No more pizza pizza or dominos for me !	5.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	This is the best pizza place in the Annex by far . Forget about Famoso , Hey Lucy , etc . , and definitely forget about Pizza Pizza . We walked by this place a million times without noticing it before finally ordering a couple of pizzas and I cannot believe we 've been missing out for so long ! We are regulars now , and the pizza and service are always great . Our go-to pie is the spinotta on thin whole wheat crust . Crispy , flavorful , and unique . Try this place out immediately ! !	5.0	business
1DjtSWDLN16UTffEEu9V8A	Really good crust and pepperoni . I was skeptical at first but this place was really good . I watched the guys making the pizzas and cooking it in the oven to perfection . Check this place out if you like a good slice / pie !	4.0	business
