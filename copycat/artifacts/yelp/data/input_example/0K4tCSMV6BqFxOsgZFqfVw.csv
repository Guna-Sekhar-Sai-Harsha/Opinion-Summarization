0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	My friend stayed at Orleans and bought be 6 giant truffles . I was so excited ! ! I was so disappointed they had an odd aftertaste like it was old . I think grocery store chocolate may have a slight edge.The good news is I saved myself from 10,000 calories .. who am I kidding I had to try them to see if they were all horrible . All but one which I have away 9000 calories in 3 days	1.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	Found this golden gem inside Orleans Hotel by accident . Lady who 's in the counter was friendly . We got the Pretzel dark chocolate and Kahlua Truffle , both THE BOMB ! ! ! !	5.0	business

Shop is clean and smells good . Customer service was excellent and very friendly . Definitely coming back soon	4.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	Pretty good . It 's one of my favorite places to go when I want fresher chocolate . The only downside is probabbly the limited supply of some of the chocolates / candies . They run out pretty fast .	4.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	Chocoholic so every time I go to The Orleans I grab a little treat . I stay here so it is convenient to grab some chocolate . Very tasty love the dark chocolate pretzels or the graham crackers . I have had other things but its ok . Gets expensive if you get a couple . Have gotten the apples and they are good . They also can split it for you there to eat immediately . Or you can have them uncut and they will make it with you all the way home .	4.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	This is a very terrible place to get apples covered in sweet things . The service is horrible . This place only got 1 star is because the caramel apple is just descent enough to be good . And to be honest , i think that they could do way better but they are too lazy .	1.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	This place never has fudge available . I come about once a month and they always say they 'll have it later but they never do . The attitude is horrible and they expect a tip !	1.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	Tucked away inside The Orleans casino & Hotel.I you haven 't been there before , RMCF is just after the gift shop along your way to your rooms.They have a great selection of chocolate covered pretzels , fruit , graham crackers and other various things you can cover in chocolate.They seem to have discontinue some of the chocolate things like the Raspberry cremes . But it 's really minor , when you see what else they have to offer.They also offer a wider selection of caramel apples with different toppings.Apple pie and the walnut covered are really good.They also carry a small selection of holiday themed candies , depending on what holiday is current.Friendly staff .	4.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	Nice little store . They have great fudge , great carmel apples . The place is never too busy and the staff is always patient and nice . They give small samples which helps me pick the tastiest treat . The chocolate factory is near the hotel elevators . A very convenient place to get your late night sweets .	5.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	Just had a piece of toffee covered in milk chocolate . Excellent . Good thing I only got one . Way good and I could not have left another to wait . Very good quality overall . I will return .	4.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	Chocolate pecan bears and chocolate caramel popcorn are the two things I got to try from here . I didn 't even know they had this place in Vegas and so it was a nice little surprise to find out this place existed.The chocolate caramel popcorn was sweet and crispy . It was great.The chocolate pecan bears were individually wrapped and each one had some pecans and chewy caramel inside . This was a nice sweet treat too.Tasty treats from this place can only make the Vegas experience even sweeter !	3.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	Great customer service , and great treats . I had the chocolate covered strawberries and they were fantastic . The store was clean and had a great vibe . Maggie was very helpful and gave me a 10 / 10 experience . Definitely plan on returning .	5.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	I 've walked by here many times in my stays at The Orleans . Not much of a sweets person and the place is ALWAYS packed . When I was leaving on my last stay I noticed they had a coffee and pastry special and I hoped it would be better than what I would normally get on my way out of town at the gas station . The coffee was only ok but the fresh pastries I got were very good ! Of course being fresh the icing was gooey and got all over me on my way down the road . : - )	4.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	Drove here for one thing , a caramel apple and got it . Person that serve me was pleasant . I asked her to have the manager call me about a potential partnership for product with the company I work for , to other their product as a gift to my guests . Never heard from the manager , a missed oppty .	4.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	I went here specifically for a caramel apple craving ... the apples were just okay . The caramel isn 't consistent---it 's really dark in color on some of the apples and really light tan color on others . They need to heat the caramel to an exact temperature every single time to get it perfect . It 's not a Disneyland Caramel Apple but it did help my sweet tooth . I also order 1 / 2 pound of chocolate walnut fudge . The fudge was very dry and basically crumbled and turned mostly into dust . Apples 2.5 / 5Fudge 1 / 5Friendly 5 / 5	2.0	business
0K4tCSMV6BqFxOsgZFqfVw	Got a groupon coupon to try out the chocolate , unfortunately it was limited , to candied apples , dipped strawberries , fudge ( which I am not a fan of fudge ) and bark ... I was hoping to try the other chocolates in the small little store , oh well , will probably not go back , as you have to go thru the casino to get there , and drop a few quarters along the way ... The bark is ok , it is like eating a slab of chocolate , , I wish there were nuts in them .. Really rich chocolate , it was tasty , , but I preferred a different selection ....	3.0	business
