1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	First he doesn 't listen to my order or give me attention . And forgot to give me my hamburger . And gave me two breads and a piece of chicken as a sanwich ! Lazy employee named John . Needs to be cleaning not taking orders !	1.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	Ahhh fast food ! Its all the same ! Well here the food isnt super greasy ! ! I love the grilled chicken options they have as well as their breakfast sandwich , but i get it without ham ! The price is ok , you pay for what you get right ? I also like their curly fries ! One weird thing is that they do not give a toy with the kids meals ! Left my son hangin ! Anway I come here when Im in this area .	4.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	Stopped here today at 5 : 30am after work for the two for $ 3 Jumbo Jacks . Both burgers were great and just the way I ordered them . But the highlight of the visit was an employee named Alexander . He was so friendly and nice . I wish everyone had the positive attitude he had . What a great employee and a real asset to your company ! !	5.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	After a terrible experience the first time I tried jack in the box years ago Iv been hesitant to try it again .. But wow . This has change my mind for good ! Best burger from a big corporate chain Iv had hands down ( bacon Swiss on a butter bun ) .Fries were fresh hot and crispy with the right amount of salt.Couldn 't fault the service . All round great experience .	5.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	It 's a 24 hrs fast food It 's now well over 35mins we are at the window . Fast food should be a lot quicker If u have no options the this is the place I could be back But the food sucks Later nighters can 't expect gourmet food	1.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	Just bought 4 Breakfast Jacks.Most locations are good.This location today badly over microwaved my BJ ! Buns were really Gummy & shrunken ! I thought they had specific required timing but they probably threw all 4 in at one time & microwaved the hell out of it ? ? ? I usually love eating Breakfast Jack but not today ! Ruined my craving !	1.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	Service definitely not with a smile , but the food is consistent . I wish the tacos came without sauce standard . They 're not edible with the sauce so when they mess that up it is saddening . Our guy tonight was Matthew - he had trouble hearing us and was obviously frustrated at the issue . Very snippy .	3.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	This location is always fast and they get the orders right every time . I have never been shorted an item . This place is usually very lean and the staff pretty nice.I love Jack in the Box for one reason and one reason only-- TACOS ! ! ! They are nasty greasy but OMG good . Me and the BF love to go here and order like 12 then come home and just stiff our faces . I have had a chicken sandwich here one time and it was also really good . I just can 't bring myself to get away from these tacos . 2 for .99 is a great deal ! !	4.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	Service is always fast and my food is always warm . They always get my order right and they always ask if I want more ketchup or hot sauce they are very friendly and have great attitudes	5.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	Ok guys , this is a fast food joint ! So rating it like its red lobster isn 't fair . They are always clean , there 's good parking , and I haven 't experienced long wait times ..... but again ..... it is fast food , so if you go at 12pm then c 'mon ! ! ! ! ! ! I gave it 4 stars because the order does come out different at times , but the ratio is great .	4.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	This place is across from the college , and I 'm sure gets a lot of student business , but I 've never seen more than three people in it . Those three people are usually homeless . The last time I went in for a quick 2 Tacos for $ 1 I was asked forMoney five times in twenty min . That 's about typical here . They are almost always out of cherries gor the shakes , or they just don 't want to add them , who knows . When I left I felt vaguely sticky , and drove with the windows down for a while . Seemed to help .	2.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	No complaints- it is your typical J in the B with lots of options and specials . Friendly service , although the drive thru was pretty slow . I sampled my fries before I left and mentioned they were a little cold , so they gave me some fresh , hot fries and didn 't want the old ones back . They never have a problem giving you extra sauces or anything like that , either .	4.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	Jack used to be my favorite fast food burger chain , but recently their food is significantly less delicious . I 've been getting a Jumbo Jack and Chicken Sandwich here a couple times a month for about a year now , and in the past few months both of these sandwiches have gotten pretty unappetizing . They are dry and tasteless . I 'm no longer a customer for this chain .	2.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	4 stars compared to other fast food and other Jack in the Box locations . They present your food in a little better fashion if you are a dine-in customer . Tacos look gross but are cheap and taste good for the price . Stuffed jalape√±os are just as good as anywhere else , but a little pricey for a fast food location . Mini churros were a mistake , not the greatest but they are a cheap dessert option and were edible .	4.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	I love this Jack in the Box restaurant because it 's not so busy all the time . They have polite employees & quick customer service .. It 's also very clean	5.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	What can I say , jack in the box is one of the most inexpensive food chains out there and their food is really quite delicious especially for the inexpensive cost .	5.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	Great customer service for a fast food place . 2 employees for the early morning shift . The front / drive thru employee handling both counter and drive thru . Very nice apologizing every minute for the wait . We didn 't wait long at all . Food was good , fresh made . Very good experience at Jack in the box .	5.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	This has to be the worst Jack in the Box I 've ever been to . Does not matter if the restaurant is empty because they always take 20min for your order . The employees were extremely rude because an older couple asked a question about the price that the cashier could not answer so she replied with " I don 't care , tommorow is my last day " . They were older and it was a simple question that if she did not know the answer too she could have simply asked someone else . Sucks that they are across the street from my house .	1.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	Jumbo Jacks and their milkshakes are the two main reasons for me visiting Jack In The Box . This has been true since I was in college . This location is clean , the staff are on the ball , orders are always correct and ready in a reasonable amount of time.I am a fan , even though I try to cut back on fast food chains in general .	4.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	While I 'd weigh 400 lbs ( or more ) again , I could honestly eat here weekly and be SOOOO happy with life ! The food was decent for the price you pay ... and I didn 't get sick : - ) ROCK ON !	3.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	Jack is the spot for greasy fast food- and sometimes that 's all you want ! ! Get the chicken strips , and a grip of ranch . YUM !	3.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	Got cheese burger , 2 tacos & a coke . The food here is terrible . I use to go to Jack in a Box a lot in the past but when I came today for lunch it was terrible nothing was fresh everything tasted like horrible left overs even the coke was bad . The cheese burger had a funny taste to it I can 't even explain & the tacos were bland & the lettuce was old that it was turning brown , gross ! I won 't be coming back . Next time drive an extra mile & go to In-n-Out their food is always fresh !	1.0	business
1gjhtfYxlN-0xjS9Xdh66g	Closest Jack 's to my place . Like coming here since they offer 10 % off . Decent deal to grab a burger or some tacos . It 's fast food so not much to say . Just trying to get a bang for my buck . Service is great and the place is clean . Parking is easy since it 's a big lot .	4.0	business
