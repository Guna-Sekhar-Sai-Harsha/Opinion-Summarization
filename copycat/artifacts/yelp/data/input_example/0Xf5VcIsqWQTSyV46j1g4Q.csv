0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	Worst hotel ever ! ! ! Completely disgusting and the staff was rude ! ! ! The hotel reeked of cigarettes and our room looked like a homeless person was living in it . Also , It appeared that there were " transactions " being made in the lobby . I would rather sleep on the floor of the airport then ever return to this repulsive hotel .	1.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	TASHA at the front desk has quite a little nasty attitude on her .. she 's rude and unprofessional . I think she 's out grown working at a counter . She 's short patient and unwilling to provide true customer service ... with a smile ... room service might be more fitting since she works best alone ... can I rate no stars ? !	1.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	Hotel was disgusting . There were stains on sheets and had dirty towels . Asked for clean towels and an hour later they only brought one , had to wait another 20 minutes for them to bring again . I wish I read these reviews prior to staying here .	1.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	We waited for an hour for the shuttle and ended up taking a cab because it never showed up , even when we called the front desk and she said it was " on it 's way . " The hotel is run down and has a funny smell . Room was not very clean , bed was made with new sheets but it was tough falling asleep on 30 thread count sheet . Would not recommend it .	1.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	This is about as gross as you can get .... it smells horrible and utterly flithy . AVOID THIS HOTEL ! But seriously , it smells disgusting and it 's nauseating . Another tragic feature or lack of feature is that there are no curtains to close when you want to sleep or undress . The entire parking lot can see into your room . Sadly , there was a street light right outside of my window that was shining in my room and it was really hard to sleep ( see pic ) .	1.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	Avoid this hotel . The rooms and hallways felt somewhere between cheap dormitory and prison . Walls are not very soundproof , I heard yelling in the next room until 4 am . The overall feel is dirty , in spite of the sanitation score listed in the lobby . Did not feel safe trying the free breakfast , so I have no idea how it was .	1.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	One star because the bed was decent and Yelp doesn 't low anything lower . Everything else was absolutely awful . Bad breakfast . Bad carpet . Small outdated bathroom . Broken coffee pot . Loud halls . I didn 't book this hotel . It was the only thing available when I got in a travel pinch and now I know why .	1.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	would get one star if it wasn 't for Tim , the most enthusiastic and positively minded shuttle driver in America . The front desk ( yes , you robert ) was terse , rude , and eye-stabbingly slow during a checkin of several stranded flyers . It was like he was deliberately moving slow just to punish us. check in with 4 people in line took over 35 minutes even though we all had the same airline voucher for our stay . I slept on top of the comforter at night after reading other reviews .	2.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	After my flight was cancelled , this is the hotel that I was provided with by the airline . After a 50 minute wait for a shuttle to the hotel , I arrived at the front desk and then waited 20 minutes because the computer was down . Finally got to the room , and the TV had no remote and would not turn on at the switch . Then I noticed a piece of what looked like a broken grounding post off of a cord to a hair dryer stuck in the bathroom outlet . This is the worst hotel that I 've ever stayed in , negative star rating .	1.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	If I could give it ZERO stars I would . DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION . Rooms are filthy and the managers make you feel slightly uncomfortable . We saw the room and left . Kind of the scene for a thriller movie .	1.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	Fucking place . Don 't stay there . They were so rude and fucking duty on the bed . Plz trust me they don 't do cancelation when i just cancel my trip	1.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	Nasty would be an understatement . Dead Roach when we walked in the room . American Airline placed us with this hotel . I would never book a 1 star hotel . Needless to say slept 2 hours , in clothes with towels on top of the bed . Couldn 't leave quick enough . First shuttle to airport we got on would much rather sleep in a airport chair .	1.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	Was put here after I missed my connection . Clearly , as my mom always reminds me , you get what you pay for . After sitting at the airport last night for about half an hour waiting for the shuttle , now told that the shuttle will be 10 minutes late this morning . That was 20 minutes ago . Not a surprise given other comments on this place.Unpleasant stale odor ? Check.Seedy feel ? Check.Owner clearly milking this place for every dime . The only partially redeeming quality ? Front desk associate was friendly and courteous.Thankfully , I don 't plan on missing a lot of flights at CLT ...	1.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	Hotel was like others said old and ran down feeling . Smelled like an old building that hadn 't been used in a long time . Wall socket had a short in it , had to wiggle the cords in the socket to get it to work . Fire Hazard ? I think so ! On a very positive note , the bed was exceptionally good .	2.0	business
0Xf5VcIsqWQTSyV46j1g4Q	Yuck ! ! A missed flight and a coupon from us airways got me stuck in this pit . It 's by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in . Like a previous reviewer stated , I would rather sleep on the airport floor . I can 't believe us airways sends people here . I plan to avoid us airways in the future if this is considered acceptable to them . Dirty scary hotel. lots of sketchy looking young men hanging around the lobby .	1.0	business
